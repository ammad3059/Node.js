/* Tradeoff between performance vs consistency

1) using reference appraoch(normalization)  --> consistency
let author = {
    name: "mosh"
}

let course = {
    code: "mt-19",
    author: 'ref-id'
}


2) using embedded document appraoch(denormalization)  --> query performance
let course = {
    code: "mt-19",
    author: {
        name : "mosh" complete properties
    }
}

3) using Hybrid appraoch

let author = {
    name: "mosh"
    50 more properties
}

let course = {
    code: "mt-19",
    author: {
        id: "ref-id",
        name: "mosh"  selected properties
    }
}
